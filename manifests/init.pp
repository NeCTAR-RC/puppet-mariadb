# Class: mariadb
#
#   This class installs mariadb client software.
#
# Parameters:
#   [*package_ensure*]
#     Ensure value for the package. Set to `present` or a version number.
#     If setting a version number see note below on `version`. Ex.
#     '5.5.37'.
#   [*package_names*]
#     Array of names of the mariadb client packages.
#   [*version*]
#     Sets the version string for mariadb. For Debian-based systems a
#     'major.minor' version is expected. Ex. '5.5'. Set a more specific
#     version using `package_ensure` parameter. For RedHat-based systems a
#     full version is required. Ex. '5.5.37'. This is due to the way the
#     yum package repo is configured.
#   [*manage_repo*]
#     If true, manage the yum or apt repo.
